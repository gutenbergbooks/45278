      T will be readily understood by our young readers, that the real name of
      the little girl who is the heroine of this story was not Goody Two Shoes,
      but Margery Meanwell. Her father, Mr. Meanwell, was for many years a very
      respectable farmer in the parish of Mouldwell, where Margery was born; but
      misfortunes, and the cruel persecutions of Sir Timothy Gripe, his
      landlord, and the rich Farmer Graspall, ruined this worthy man, and was
      the source of all poor Margery's troubles.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      Farmer Meanwell died soon after of a broken heart, and his poor wife,
      unable to struggle with misfortunes, only survived him a few days, leaving
      their unfortunate offspring, Margery and Tommy, friendless orphans in an
      unpitying world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loss of their parents seemed to endear these orphans more to each
      other, and they were continually seen strolling hand in hand about the
      village, as if they were afraid of being separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had relations&mdash;but as they were rich, they took no notice of
      these poor children; being ashamed to own such a little ragged girl as
      Margery, and such a dirty curly-headed boy as Tommy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Smith, the clergyman of the parish where Margery and Tommy were born,
      was a very worthy man, and being at this time visited by a rich and
      charitable friend, he told him the story of the poor orphans. The stranger
      gave Mr. Smith money to buy some clothes for Margery, and said that he
      would make Tommy a little sailor. Tommy was happy to hear this, and next
      day the gentleman bought him a jacket and trowsers, of which he was very
      proud. Margery could never give over admiring Tommy in his new dress; but
      her happiness met with a severe check, for the gentleman was to return to
      London in a few days, and to take Tommy along with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parting of these children was very affecting; poor Margery's eyes were
      red with crying, and her cheeks pale with grief, while little Tommy, by
      way of consolation, said he would never forget his dear sister, and kissed
      her a hundred times over. As Tommy left his sister, he wiped her eyes with
      the corner of his jacket, and promised to return, and bring her fine
      things from abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Margery found that Tommy did not come back, she cried all day until
      she went to bed, and next morning she went round every one in the village,
      weeping and lamenting that her brother Tommy was gone. Fortunately, while
      she was in this distress, the shoemaker came with a pair of new shoes,
      which the gentleman had ordered for her, and it being so long since little
      Margery wore a pair of shoes, her attention was so engaged as to give a
      new turn to her thoughts. Nothing but the pleasure of examining her two
      shoes could have put a stop to the violence of her grief. She immediately
      put on the shoes, and then went to let Mrs. Smith see them. It was with
      delight that little Margery exhibited them to her benefactress, saying,
      "Two shoes, ma'am! see, two shoes!" She then went through the whole
      village to show her new shoes, addressing them in the same way, until she
      got the name of "Little Two Shoes," but, being a very good child, they
      usually called her "Little Goody Two Shoes," and she never entirely lost
      that name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Margery was destitute of friends; but, although very young, she
      contrived to meet the children as they returned from school, and prevailed
      on one of them to learn her the alphabet. She used to borrow their books,
      and sit down and read till they came from dinner. It was by these means
      that she soon acquired more learning than her playmates at school, and in
      a short time she formed a little plan for instructing children who had not
      yet learned to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found that there were twenty-six letters in the alphabet, and every
      word spelled with them; but as these letters might be either large or
      small, she cut, out of little pieces of wood, ten sets of the alphabet in
      small letters, and ten of the large, or capitals. With the assistance of
      an old spelling-book, she made her companions arrange the words they
      wanted to spell out of her wooden alphabets, and then showed them how to
      make sentences. When they wished to play at this game, she placed the
      children around her, and gave them a word to spell. If the word was
      plum-pudding, the first brought the letter <i>p</i>, the second <i>i</i>,
      the third <i>u</i>, the fourth <i>m</i>, and so on, till the whole was
      completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this method, in a short time Margery gained such great credit among the
      parents of the children that they were all happy when she appeared with
      the basket of letters in her hand, which proved a source of amusement as
      well as instruction, and she at last had a regular set of scholars.

    <p>
      Margery usually left home at seven o clock in the morning, and the first
      house she called at was Farmer Wilson's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilson always received her with pleasure, saying, "O Little Goody, I
      am glad to see you&mdash;Billy has learned his lesson." The little boy was
      equally happy to see her; and after giving him his lesson, she went to
      Farmer Simpson's. A dog used to bark at her when she first went to that
      house, but he soon learned to know her, "Come in Margery," said Mrs
      Simpson, "Sally wants you very much, for she has learned her lesson."
      Little Sally began her lesson by placing the syllables of two letters,
      which she did very correctly, and pronounced them as Goody Two Shoes had
      taught her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0006" id="linkimage-0006"> </a>

    </div>
    <p>
      Some time after, as Little Goody was returning from her pupils rather
      later than usual, she was overtaken by a violent storm of thunder and
      lightning; but she took refuge in a farmer's barn, and lay down among some
      straw at the farther end. She had not remained long, before four robbers
      also sought shelter from the storm in the same place, and not observing
      Little Goody, who was at some distance, they began to arrange their future
      plans of depredation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among other schemes of villany, they formed the resolution of breaking
      into the houses of Sir William Dove and Sir Timothy Gripe on the night
      following, and to plunder them of all their money, plate, and jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      During their conversation, Little Goody listened with great attention; but
      the tempest being over, the robbers left the barn without discovering that
      they had been overheard, When she thought they were fairly gone, Goody
      made the best of her way home; and, rising early next morning, went to Sir
      William Dove, and told him all she had heard. The knight asked her name,
      and then giving her some money, desired her to call on him next day. Goody
      next proceeded to Sir Timothy Gripe's, and sent in her name by the
      servant; but, as he refused to see her, she, with some difficulty, got
      admittance to Lady Gripe, and related what she had heard in the barn. This
      lady was a very sensible woman, and did not despise the information; but
      secretly engaged people to guard the house; and when the robbers came in
      two parties to attack both houses, they were all taken and sent to jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir William Dove, who was grateful for the service Little Goody had done
      him, said she should no longer sleep in a barn, as he would try to get
      some proper situation for her; but the wicked Sir Timothy was vexed that
      his life had been saved by her means, and never rewarded or thanked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most respectable school in that neighbourhood was conducted by a Mrs.
      Williams, a very good lady; but old age induced her to resign the
      situation, when Sir William Dove getting notice of, sent for her, and
      recommended Little Goody as a person worthy to succeed her. As Mrs.
      Williams already knew that Margery had a good heart, she found on
      examination, her head to be equally so; and being every way qualified for
      the place, Margery was, at the old lady's request, appointed to succeed
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was now no longer called <i>Margery</i> or <i>Goody Two Shoes</i>, but
      only known by the name of <i>Mrs. Margery.</i>
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      Margery had a very feeling heart, and could not endure to see even a dumb
      animal used with cruelty, without trying to prevent it. As she was one day
      walking through the village, her attention was drawn to some boys, who
      were tying a poor raven, which they had caught, to a post, on purpose to
      amuse themselves with the cruel diversion of shying, or throwing a stick
      at it. Margery, to get the raven, gave them a penny, and brought it home
      with her. She called the raven Ralph; taught him to speak and spell; and
      as he was fond of playing with the capital letters, the children called
      them Ralph's alphabet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after, when rambling in the fields, she saw two boys torturing a
      beautiful dove by allowing it to fly a little way, and then pulling it
      back again, with a string which was tied to its foot. Margery rescued this
      bird for a mere trifle, and carried it with her. She also learned the dove
      to spell with her letters, besides many other curious things; and being
      very useful in carrying letters, she called him Tom. It is a curious fact,
      that Tom showed as great a liking to the small letters as Ralph had for
      the large, and the scholars used to give them the appellation of "Tom's
      alphabet."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0008" id="linkimage-0008"> </a>

    </div>
    <p>
      Another useful assistant of Mrs. Margery's was a fine skylark, which some
      of the neighbours made her a present of. As some children are very fond of
      lying in bed too long in the morning, she sent this pretty bird, which
      sung sweetly at their window, and taught them when to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      A poor little lamb, which had lost its dam, was about to be killed by the
      butcher, when Margery making a bargain with him for it, took it home and
      called it Will. He taught the children when to go to bed, and being very
      gentle, was a great favourite; but he only carried home the satchel of
      those who behaved best and brought it again in the morning. She also got a
      present of a little dog, called Jumper, which was very sagacious, and
      might have been termed Porter of the School, for he never allowed any
      unknown person to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0009" id="linkimage-0009"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/8009.jpg" alt="8009 " width="100%" /><br /><a
      href="images/8009.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </div>
    <p>
      Shortly after, little Jumper gave a wonderful proof of his sagacity. The
      children had just finished their lessons, when the dog ran in, and seizing
      Margery's apron, tried to pull her out of the schoolroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      She allowed the dog to drag her out to the garden, and he returned and
      brought out one of the children in the same manner; upon which Mrs Margery
      called them all into the garden. This saved all their lives, for in less
      than five minutes after, the roof of the house fell in.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a great loss to Mrs. Margery, who had no place to teach in; but
      Sir William Dove caused another school to be built at his own expense, and
      she got the use of Farmer Grove's hall till it was ready, which was in the
      centre of the village. While there she learned the farmer's servants and
      neighbours to read and write, and by degrees became so esteemed in the
      parish, that almost every one consulted her, and many serious disputes
      where settled by her advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Margery, who was always doing good, contrived an instrument to tell
      when the weather was to continue favourable or unfavourable; by which
      means she told the farmers when to mow the arrass and gather in the hay
      with safety. Several persons, who suffered in their crops by not
      consulting Margery, were so angry at their losses, that they accused her
      of being a witch and sent Gaffer Goosecap, a silly old meddling fool, to
      obtain evidence against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This old fellow entered the school as Margery was walking about, having
      the raven on one shoulder, the pigeon on the other, the lark on her hand,
      and the lamb and dog at her side, and he was so frightened, that he cried.
      "A witch! a witch!"
    </p>
<p>
Margery exclaimed, smiling, "A conjurer! a conjurer!" and he ran off;
but soon after a warrant was issued against her, and she was carried
before a meeting of the justices, followed by all the neighbours.
</p>

    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0010" id="linkimage-0010"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="figleft" style="width:50%;">

      href="images/9010.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </div>
    <p>
      Although this accusation met with the contempt it deserved, yet one of the
      magistrates was silly enough to believe the slander, and asked, who could
      give her a character. Margery inquired if any one there could speak
      against it, and told them, that she had many friends both able and willing
      to defend her; but she could not think of troubling them on such a silly
      business, for if she was a witch, she would show them her charm. She then
      took out her weather-glass, and placed it upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Charles Jones, who was present on this occasion, was so delighted with
      her conduct, that he offered her a handsome annuity to superintend his
      family and the education of his daughter. This she refused at first, but
      Sir Charles being seized with a severe illness, and again entreating her,
      she at last consented. In this situation, she conducted herself with so
      much propriety, and behaved so tenderly to his daughter, that on his
      recovery, when she proposed to leave him, he made her an offer of his
      hand. Margery knew the real value of the worthy baronet, and esteemed him
      as he deserved: therefore, after he had amply provided for his daughter
      she consented to become Lady Jones.
    </p>

    <p>
      When this circumstance was understood in the neighbourhood, it diffused a
      general joy throughout the village, where Margery was greatly beloved, and
      brought crowds to witness the marriage. The clergyman was proceeding with
      the ceremony, when a young gentleman, handsomely dressed, came running
      into the church, and requested that the ceremony, might, be stopped until
      he had a conversation with the bride. The whole assembly were astonished
      at his request, particularly the bride and bridegroom, who stood
      motionless, without having power to return an answer to the stranger.
      However, the gentleman coming forward, discovered himself to be Tommy, her
      brother, and she fainted away in his arms.

      departure.
